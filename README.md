# Genetic Image Generator/Compressor

This project uses a genetic algorithm to generate an image based on a given heuristic function. The demo shows how it can be used to generate an existing image with the attemp to compress the file size. There is a full report included (Report.pdf) on how the algorithm works which I encourage you to read after looking at the demo.
